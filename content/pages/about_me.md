Title: About Me

I used to blog when it was much less common and I had very little worth saying.  Nowadays everyone has a blog, and it is debatable whether I have anything worth saying (definitely more than before, but there are so many good blogs out there!).  So why blog?

Well, like I said, everyone has a blog. ;)

With caveats out of the way, here's a bit about me:

Most of my adult life has revolved around mathematics; I have a PhD in topology, an area which strikes most people as pretty absurd, since its practitioners appear to spend a great deal of time turning rubbery shapes inside-out.  Obviously I did it for love, not money.  When I realized money was useful, I wound up working in financial services, eventually at a hedge fund in New York City, mainly building tools for research and trading.

While I did learn a lot from Wall Street, I found I enjoyed the tech more than the finance.  Currently I spend most of my working hours wrangling with Python and Django at a fintech startup.

*But don't get me wrong.*  This blog is meant to be a space unrelated to tech/finance/data science/quant stuff.  I intend this as a kind of playground where sheer frivolity and more deeper(?) philosophical musings can co-mingle.  Of course... I could just end up posting a bunch of technical stuff or not much at all.  We'll see!
