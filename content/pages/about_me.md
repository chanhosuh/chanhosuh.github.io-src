Title: About Me

A short summary of my background might help you get a sense of why I might approach topics the way I do.  

Most of my adult life has revolved around mathematics; I have a PhD in topology, an area which strikes most people as pretty absurd, since its practitioners appear to spend a great deal of time turning rubbery shapes inside-out.  Obviously I did it for love, not money.  Nowadays I work for a hedge fund in New York City, mainly building tools for research and trading.  I do this mainly for money.

While I do find my job and related activities fascinating, this blog is intended primarily as an space unrelated to finance/data science/quant stuff.  I intend this as a kind of playground where sheer frivolity and more deeper(?) philosophical musings can co-mingle.
