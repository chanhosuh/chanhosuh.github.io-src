Title: About Me

I work in the intersection of finance, technology, and data science for an investment management firm in New York City.  

This blog is my way of focusing and organizing thoughts and interests revolving around... well, finance, technology, and data science.  And more philosophical musings about consciousness, life, and the Universe.

Feel free to contact me if the mood strikes.
