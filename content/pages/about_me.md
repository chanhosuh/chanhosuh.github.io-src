Currently I work in fintech as a software developer, mainly wrangling with backend stuff in Python and Django.  I spent several years working on [Wall Street](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street), supporting [trading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trader_(finance)) in various capacities.  Before that, I was a full-fledged academic, spending a lot of time [turning things inside-out.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology)
